			<div class="question">Why Should I Go With A Themezier Theme?</div>
			<div class="answer">
			  <p>Our themes are designed to give you the most amount of freedom without having to sell your arm. You'll find that our Weebly themes have built-in exclusive features not yet found on themes that cost twice as much.</p>
              <p>We've been a part of the Weebly community since 2011 and really know what a 
 Weebly user needs to truly build a great website.</p>
              <p>You can learn more about <a href="https://www.themezier.com/blog/what-makes-themezier-themes-different">what's makes Themezier themes different</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">Do I Only Have To Pay Once For A Theme?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>Yes. The price you see on a theme page is the one-time price you pay for that theme. What you see is what you pay. Done. There are <b>absolutely no monthly subscriptions or upgrades fees</b>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">What If I Need Support For A Theme?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>Then we are here to help!</p>
              <p>If after purchasing or downloading one of our Weebly themes, you run into any issues with the theme, we encourage you to <a href="https://m.me/themezier" target="_blank">open a support ticket</a>. We're very prompt with issues regarding our themes, with a usual less than 2 hour response time once a support ticket is submitted.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">What is "Free Installation"?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>"Free Installation" means that once you purchase or download one of our themes, we'll be happy to install it into your Weebly account for you absolutely free.</p>
            </div>
  
            <div class="question">What Are "Free Lifetime Upgrades"?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>"Free Lifetime Upgrades" means you'll receive free updates for any Themezier theme, for as long as you use the theme.</p>
              <p>The e-mail you use to purchase or download one of our themes is the e-mail that we send upgrade notifications to. Once an upgrade is available for your theme, you'll receive an e-mail containing a download button for the latest version of your theme.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">What Is An "Unlimited Domain Use" License?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>Our "Unlimited Domain Use" license grants <b>you</b> the freedom to use any of our Weebly themes on as many domains that <b>you</b> own.</p>
              <p>If you are a contractor web designer building a website for a client, your client must purchase or download the theme they wish to use for their website(s), even if you've already purchase said theme for use on your own website(s).</p>
              <p>This license grants unlimited theme usage strictly and only for the owned sites of the individual purchaser of the theme.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">What Is Your Return Policy?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>30 days. If for whatever reason you're not content with a Weebly theme you've purchased from us, we'll be happy to provide you with a 100% refund within 30 days of its purchase.</p>
              <p>We know that it's impossible to know if you'd like one of our Weebly themes without actually trying it, which is why we want you to feel absolutely confident in purchasing from us. We'll take this hit, even though our theme's are technically not returnable because of their digital and easily replicable nature.</p>
              <p><b>Please Note:</b> Since our Weebly themes are technically not returnable, we're also aware that some may unscrupulously attempt to take advantage of this. If we determine this situation to be the case, we will not provide a refund, except in cases where a theme has a bug, that could not be resolved on our end through a newer version of that theme.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">Can You Help Me Customize A Theme?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>Of course! We totally understand that the Weebly themes we offer may not meet your site's specific vision right out-of-the-box, so you can hire Themezier to perform custom code work to any Weebly theme.</p>
              <p>If you're interested in hiring Themezier to perform custom code work on your Weebly theme, just <a href="https://m.me/themezier" target="_blank">open a support ticket</a> and we'll get back to you promptly.</p>
